Lands specs
- A map have a Land ids range i.e [1-100] and a size 15x25
- As the game grow and have multiple map, ids will follow the previous map [1-100] -> [101-200] ...
- Game server should have an init phase where loading basic lands spec and current state (which one is minted or not)



BUY/SELL/LEND FLOW

Initial sale:
- Lands are minted by users
- Tower are purchased by users

Game starting:
- A Land and a Tower are staked together in order to participate to the game

Re-sell:
- In order to be sold, a land must have no tower on it
- In order to be sold, a tower must not be on a land

Lending:
- hmm

Why?
- If a Land has a tower on it and the user sell the land, what happen to the tower ?
